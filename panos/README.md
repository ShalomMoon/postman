# Palo Alto PANOS
Postman collection to interact with the Palo Alto PANOS REST API with a few
requests leverage the legacy XML API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `panos`: Contains a general environment template for a
    privately-built PANOS instance (not a public sandbox). Be
    sure to change the version tag based on your PANOS version and
    to perform an admin password reset as required.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
