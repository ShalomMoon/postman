# Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) openVuln API
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco PSIRT openVuln API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection,
  * `psirt`: Contains host/credential information which users can
    populate. The `client_id` and `client_secret` are used to obtain
    a token. The `client_token` is used for all subsequent requests.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
