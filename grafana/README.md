# Grafana
Postman collection to interact with the Grafana data visualization
and dashboard solution (open source).

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `njr_tig_stack`: For a quick start, you can use my personal
    TIG stack repository (`https://github.com/nickrusso42518/tig-stack`)
    which quickly creates all the required TIG components.
    The other components, Telegraf and InfluxDB, are used to
    collect and store the data that Grafana displays. The
    environment contains the required variable values with the
    exception of the hostname/IP address, which users should
    replace based on the environment.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
