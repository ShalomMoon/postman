# Cisco UCM
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
using the Administrative XML (AXL) API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `reservable`: Contains connectivity information for the DevNet UCM
    reservable sandboxes (all versions) and can be editted for other
    environments. Change the `schema_ver` to interact with versions of UCM.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
