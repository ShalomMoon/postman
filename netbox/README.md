# NetBox
Postman collection to interact with the NetBox network management
and planning solution (open source).

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `community_docker`: For a quick start, you can use the community
    docker repository (`https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox-docker`)
    which quickly creates all the required NetBox components. The
    environment contains the required variable values with the
    exception of the hostname/IP address, which users should
    replace based on the environment.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
