# Prometheus
Postman collection to interact with the Prometheus instrumentation and
metric collection solution (open source).

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `prometheus_docker`: For a quick start, you can use this official
    Docker container (`https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/`)
    which quickly builds Prometheus. Users must update the environment with
    the correct IP/hostname information. The API does not require any
    authentication (not natively supported at the time of this writing).

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
