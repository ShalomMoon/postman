# PeeringDB
Postman collection to interact with the PeeringDB API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
This API offers read-only service for unathenticated clients. Because I am
neither a customer of PeeringDB nor an IX operator/participant, I don't
have credentials or write-access. No environments are included at this time.
