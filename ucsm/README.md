# Cisco UCS Manager
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco UCS Manager HTTP (XML-based) API.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `reservable`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable UCS Manager/UCS Director instance, which requires a DevNet
    account and valid reservation to utilize.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
