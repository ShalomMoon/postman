# Cisco AppDynamics
Postman collection to interact with the Cisco AppDynamics HTTP API.
Some targets are RESTful but not all are.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `reservable`: Contains host/credential information for the Cisco DevNet
    reservable AppDynamics instance, which require a DevNet account and
    valid reservation to utilize.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
