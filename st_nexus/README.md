# Sonatype Nexus
Postman collection to interact with the Sonatype Nexus repository manager.

## Usage
Be sure to check the folder descriptions for a summary of each workflow,
and note that each request has at least one "example" showing the response
format.

## Environments
There is one environment included with the collection:
  * `st_nexus`: Template environment that pre-populates some
    common/default values for a private environment. Users must update
    the environment with the correct IP/hostname information.
    Most requests require HTTP basic authentication, but not all.

You can add custom environments for your own networks as you see fit.
